      Inline CSS is useful for quick testing or when you want to apply unique
      styling to a single element without affecting others. However, it is not
      recommended for large-scale web development because it mixes content with
      presentation, making the HTML harder to read and maintain. It also
      overrides styles from internal and external stylesheets due to its higher
      specificity. Overall, inline CSS should be used sparingly and preferably
      avoided in professional projects

      Internal CSS is useful when you want to style a single page uniquely
      without affecting other pages. It's more organized than inline CSS because
      it separates structure and style, but it still keeps both in one file.
      However, it is less efficient than external CSS for styling multiple
      pages. It's mainly used for small websites or testing purposes in
      development.

     This approach keeps HTML structure and CSS styling separate, making the code more organized and easier to maintain. It allows you to reuse the same CSS file across multiple web pages, improving consistency and reducing duplication. External CSS is ideal for larger websites as it supports modular design and reduces page clutter. However, it requires an internet connection or correct file path to load properly. Itâ€™s the most recommended practice for professional and scalable web development projects.
